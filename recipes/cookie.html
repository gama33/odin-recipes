        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>Butter cookies (or butter biscuits), otherwise known Danish biscuits, are cookies originating in Denmark consisting of butter, flour, and sugar.</p>
        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>¾ cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
            <li>½ cup cookie butter</li>
            <li>½ cup peanut butter</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ cup and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Beat butter, brown sugar, and 3/4 cup white sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Add cookie butter and peanut butter; beat until fluffy. Mix flour, egg, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the butter mixture creating a cookie dough. Roll dough into teaspoon-size balls.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/3 cup sugar into a shallow dish. Roll dough balls in the sugar to coat and arrange onto the prepared baking sheet. Press dough balls with a fork twice to flatten slightly and press a crosshatch shape into the top of the cookies.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 12 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
